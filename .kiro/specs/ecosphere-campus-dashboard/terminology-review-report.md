### 1.1 "Prototype" Label
**Status:** ✅ Present in all required locations

**Locations Found:**
- `src/components/EnergyModule.tsx` - "Prototype / Demonstration Data"
- `src/components/WasteModule.tsx` - "Prototype / Demonstration Data"
- `src/components/CarbonEstimator.tsx` - "Prototype / Demonstration Data"
- `src/components/ClimateModule.tsx` - "Prototype / Demonstration Data"
- `src/components/ClimateModule.tsx` - "Prototype Acoustic Data"
- `src/pages/OverviewDashboard.tsx` - "Prototype Dashboard – Demonstration Use Only"

### 1.2 "Demonstration" Label
**Status:** ✅ Present in all required locations

**Locations Found:**
- All module components include "Prototype / Demonstration Data"
- Overview Dashboard includes "Demonstration Use Only"

### 1.3 "Awareness" Terminology
**Status:** ✅ Used appropriately throughout

**Locations Found:**
- Page title: "Climate Awareness"
- Module title: "Climate Awareness"
- Module title: "Acoustic Awareness"
- Carbon disclaimer: "for awareness purposes only"
- Climate disclaimer: "for awareness and planning support"
- Overview summary: "For awareness"

---

## 2. Required Disclaimers - VERIFIED ✅

### 2.1 Climate Indicators Disclaimer
**Status:** ✅ Present  
**Location:** `src/components/ClimateModule.tsx`  
**Text:** "Climate indicators are for awareness and planning support, not prediction."

### 2.2 Carbon Footprint Disclaimer
**Status:** ✅ Present  
**Location:** `src/components/CarbonEstimator.tsx`  
**Text:** "Estimated carbon footprint (for awareness purposes only)"

### 2.3 Acoustic Data Disclaimer
**Status:** ✅ Present  
**Location:** `src/components/ClimateModule.tsx`  
**Text:** "Acoustic data is for awareness purposes only. No audio is captured or recorded."

### 2.4 Overview Dashboard Disclaimer
**Status:** ✅ Present  
**Location:** `src/pages/OverviewDashboard.tsx`  
**Text:** "Prototype Dashboard – Demonstration Use Only"

### 2.5 Summary Metrics Disclaimers
**Status:** ✅ Present  
**Location:** `src/pages/OverviewDashboard.tsx`  
**Text:** 
- Carbon: "Estimated"
- Heat Risk: "For awareness"

---

## 3. Prohibited Terms - VERIFIED ✅

### 3.1 Search Results
The following potentially prohibited terms were searched across all `.tsx` files:

| Term | Status | Occurrences |
|------|--------|-------------|
| "predict" / "prediction" | ✅ SAFE | Only appears in disclaimer: "not prediction" |
| "accurate" / "accuracy" | ✅ SAFE | Not found |
| "monitor" / "monitoring" | ✅ SAFE | Not found |
| "guarantee" | ✅ SAFE | Not found |
| "real-time" / "realtime" | ✅ SAFE | Not found |

### 3.2 Context Check: "prediction"
The only occurrence of "predict" is in the climate disclaimer, which explicitly states the data is "not prediction" - this is appropriate and compliant.

- ✅ "Waste Management"
- ✅ "Carbon Footprint Estimate"
- ✅ "Climate Awareness"
- ✅ "Acoustic Awareness"

### 4.3 Navigation Links
- ✅ "Overview"
- ✅ "Energy Analysis"
- ✅ "Waste & Carbon"
- ✅ "Climate Awareness"

### 4.4 Empty State Messages
- ✅ "No data available for the selected filters."
- ✅ "No data available"
- ✅ "There is no data to display for the selected filters. Try adjusting your filter criteria or clearing filters to see all data."

### 4.5 Error Messages

### 4.6 Insight Text (Generated)
All insight text is generated by utility functions in `src/utils/insights.ts`:
- ✅ Energy trend insights (increase/decrease/stable)
- ✅ Waste composition insights (dominant category)
- ✅ All use appropriate, non-technical language

## 5. HTML Metadata

**File:** `index.html`  
**Title:** "ecosphere"  
**Status:** ✅ Neutral, appropriate

---

## 6. Recommendations

### 6.1 Optional Improvements
None required - all terminology is compliant.

### 6.2 Maintenance Notes
When adding new features or text:
1. Always include "Prototype / Demonstration Data" labels on new modules
2. Add appropriate disclaimers for any new data types
3. Avoid terms like: predict, accurate, monitor, guarantee, real-time
4. Use "awareness" and "planning support" terminology
5. Emphasize demonstration/prototype nature of the application

---

## 7. Conclusion

The EcoSphere+ Campus Edition codebase is **fully compliant** with terminology requirements:

✅ All required "Prototype" and "Demonstration" labels are present  
✅ All required disclaimers are in place  
✅ "Awareness" terminology is used appropriately  
✅ No prohibited terms found in user-facing text  
✅ All text emphasizes the demonstration/prototype nature of the application  

**No changes required.**
